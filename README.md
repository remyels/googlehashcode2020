This is my team's submission for Google Hash Code 2020

The naive solution is parametrized by parameters on sign up time, book score, and books per day.

The simulated annealing is an implementation on the simulated annealing algorithm on the order of the libraries, the neighbor function is defined as a swap in the order of the libraries, and the energy function gets us the score for a given order of the libraries. In the contest, we ran out of time and weren't able to use simulated annealing to an extent that is good enough to beat our greedy solution.
